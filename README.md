# WEB_3D
It is 3D web project which I build by myself while practising the various frame works based on web application.
In order to run this
fork the the repo from my profile and fetch the files to your local device.
Altough it build with HTML5 it won't run if you directly run the HTML file.

## Installation

1. Install node.js from the offical site i.e.
[Install node.js from here](https://nodejs.org/en/)


2. If you allredy have node.js installed / after installing node js.
run this comond on the terminal
`npm install`
It will install all the dependancies

3. Instead of creating a server with node.js just enter the command to execute a build in script to do so
`npm run dev`

Ta Da here you go you should have something like this running on your browser.
